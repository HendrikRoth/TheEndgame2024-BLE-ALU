## Who the F... is Alice ##

Originally inspired by the legendary TGR Alice, The ENDGAME may not win any prizes for ergonomics. But just like the Alice, it's a true icon - a masterpiece you'll want to show off, even if your fingers take a little time to get used to it.

This low-profile keyboard is designed for high-performance typing, with a slightly staggered layout that's great for ergonomic newcomers and veterans alike. Its unique bottomless top-mount design makes it super-thin, lightweight, and perfect for on-the-go use.

After three years of development and global collaboration, the ENDGAME isn't just a keyboardâ€”it's a community-driven project, embodying the journey and friendships built along the way.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed. Enjoy, have fun and remember: LOVE, PEACE, UWU and repeat.

## PARTS LIST FDM CASE ##

- 4x M3 6mm countersunk          [buy here](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4001199728978.html) 
- 4x M3 5mm flathead             [buy here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004916925259.html?) 

You can chose either countersunk or flathead, both work fine for me. Countersunk align the pcb on its own with flathead you can align it yourself and adjust if needed.
the hole for the heat inserts is 4mm deep and the pcb is 1.6mm so 5mm screws fit perfectly but check how the lenght is measured for teh screw, it differs.

- 4x M3 D4.6mm L3mm Heatinsert   [buy here](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006354505058.html?) 
- 12x M3 6.6mm grommet black     [buy here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004309686841.html?) 

You just need 4 Grommets if you want a little bit of flex or bounce. They work perfectly fine as feet and give a nice resistence on my desk but you can also use bumpons instead.
