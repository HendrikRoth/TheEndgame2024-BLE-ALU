## Who the F... is Alice ##


Originally inspired by the legendary TGR Alice, The ENDGAME may not win any prizes for ergonomics. But just like the Alice, it's a true icon a masterpiece you'll want to show off, even if your fingers take a little time to get used to it.

This low profile keyboard is designed for high performance typing, with a slightly staggered layout that's great for ergonomic newcomers and veterans alike. Its unique bottomless topmount design makes it super-thin, lightweight, and perfect for on the go use.

After three years of development and global collaboration, the ENDGAME isn't just a keyboard it's a community driven project, embodying the journey and friendships built along the way.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed. Enjoy, have fun and remember: LOVE, PEACE, UWU and repeat.

## PARTS LIST FDM CASE ##

- 4x M3 6mm countersunk          [buy here](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4001199728978.html) 
- 4x M3 5mm flathead             [buy here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004916925259.html?) 

You can choose either countersunk or flathead screws both work well. Countersunk screws automatically align the PCB, while flathead screws allow you to manually align and adjust as needed.
The hole for the heat inserts is 4mm deep, and the PCB is 1.6mm thick, so 5mm screws are a perfect fit. Just double-check how the screw length is measured, as this can vary.

- 4x M3 D4.6mm L3mm Heatinsert   [buy here](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006354505058.html?) 
- 12x M3 D6.6mm grommet black     [buy here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004309686841.html?) 

You’ll need 4 grommets if you’re aiming for a bit of flex or bounce, but you can use up to 12 depending on your preference. They work perfectly as feet and provide excellent grip on my desk. Alternatively, bumpons are a great option too.
