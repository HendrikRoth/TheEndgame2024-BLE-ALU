## Who the F... is Alice ##


Inspired by the legendary TGR Alice, the ENDGAME pays homage to a true classic. While it might not claim the top spot for ergonomics, it's design speaks for itself an iconic piece you’ll want to show off, even if it takes a bit of time for your fingers to adjust.

This low profile keyboard is built for high performance typing. Its slightly staggered layout works beautifully for both ergonomic beginners and experienced users. The unique bottomless top mount design makes it incredibly slim, lightweight, and perfect for those on the move.

## PARTS LIST FDM CASE ##

- 4x M3 6mm countersunk          [buy here](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4001199728978.html) 
- 4x M3 5mm flathead             [buy here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004916925259.html?) 

You can choose either countersunk or flathead screws both work well. Countersunk screws automatically align the PCB, while flathead screws allow you to manually align and adjust as needed.
The hole for the heat inserts is 4mm deep, and the PCB is 1.6mm thick, so 5mm screws are a perfect fit. Just double-check how the screw length is measured, as this can vary.

- 4x M3 D4.6mm L3mm Heatinsert   [buy here](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006354505058.html?) 
- 12x M3 D6.6mm grommet black     [buy here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004309686841.html?) 

You’ll need 4 grommets if you’re aiming for a bit of flex or bounce, but you can use up to 12 depending on your preference. They work perfectly as feet and provide excellent grip on my desk. Alternatively, bumpons are a great option too.

## FIRMWARE - QMK AND VIAL ##

The firmware, expertly created by [dreipunkteinsvier](https://github.com/dreipunkteinsvier), is available for download on his repository: [Get it here](https://github.com/dreipunkteinsvier/qmk-config-endgame) 
Huge thanks to him, I’d have been completely lost without his help!
