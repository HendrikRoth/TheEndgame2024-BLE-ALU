Originally inspired by the legendary TGR Alice, The ENDGAME may not win any prizes for ergonomics. But just like the Alice, it's a true icon - a masterpiece you'll want to show off, even if your fingers take a little time to get used to it.

This low-profile keyboard unlocks your true potential for high-performance typing. With a slightly staggered layout, it's perfect for curious newbies dipping their toes into the world of ergonomic keyboards, as well as seasoned veterans who've tried every bizarre layout out there and want something solid for everyday use. The never-before-seen bottomless top-mount design makes it super-thin, incredibly light and ideal for people who actually leave the house.

The ENDGAME is the ultimate AI keyboard, whether you're typing genius prompts or just ranting about AI (we won't judge). It lets you switch sides whenever you want - no need to switch keyboards.

Of course, all of this is 100% true - if you believe the marketing blah blah blah. But in the end, it's all about the friends we've made along the way. The ENDGAME is the result of a 3 year adventure to finally get things right, with a lot of help from friends all over the world. So while it may be my "ENDGAME", it's really a community project more than anything else.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed. Enjoy, have fun and remember: LOVE, PEACE, UWU... repeat.

## PARTS LIST FDM CASE ##

- 4x M3 6mm countersunk          [buy here](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4001199728978.html) 
- 4x M3 5mm flathead             [buy here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004916925259.html?) 

You can chose either countersunk or flathead, both work fine for me. Countersunk align the pcb on its own with flathead you can align it yourself and adjust if needed.
the hole for the heat inserts is 4mm deep and the pcb is 1.6mm so 5mm screws fit perfectly but check how the lenght is measured for teh screw, it differs.

- 4x M3 D4.6mm L3mm Heatinsert   [buy here](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006354505058.html?) 
- 12x M3 6.6mm grommet black     [buy here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004309686841.html?) 

You just need 4 Grommets if you want a little bit of flex or bounce. They work perfectly fine as feet and give a nice resistence on my desk but you can also use bumpons instead.
